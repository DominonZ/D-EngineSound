# Custom Engine Sounds Script for FiveM

A comprehensive FiveM script that allows players to dynamically change their vehicle engine sounds with over 100+ high-quality engine sound options from various real-world vehicles.

## Features

- **100+ Engine Sounds**: Wide variety of engine sounds from motorcycles, sports cars, supercars, muscle cars, and more
- **Permission System**: Only admins and mechanics can change vehicle sounds
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Searchable dropdown menu using ox_lib for easy sound selection
- **Real-Time Application**: Sounds are applied instantly to the vehicle
- **Descriptive Names**: All sounds have clear, descriptive names instead of cryptic codes
- **Cross-Framework Support**: Built for QBX Core framework
- **Database Persistence**: Vehicle sounds are saved and restored automatically across server restarts
- **Ownership Verification**: Only vehicle owners can change their vehicle's engine sound
- **Automatic Sound Loading**: Saved sounds are automatically applied when vehicles spawn

## Requirements

- **QBX Core**: Required for job and permission checking
- **ox_lib**: Required for the user interface and notifications
- **oxmysql**: Required for database operations and persistence
- **MySQL Database**: Required for storing vehicle sound preferences
- **FiveM Server**: Compatible with the latest FiveM builds

## Installation

1. **Download & Extract**: Place the `CUSTOMSOUNDS` folder in your `resources/***/` directory
2. **Database Setup**: The script will automatically add a `custom_sound` column to your existing `player_vehicles` table
3. **Add to server.cfg**: Add `ensure CUSTOMSOUNDS` to your server configuration file
4. **Restart Server**: Restart your FiveM server or use `refresh` and `start CUSTOMSOUNDS`

### Database Structure
The script automatically modifies your `player_vehicles` table by adding:
```sql
ALTER TABLE player_vehicles ADD COLUMN custom_sound VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL;
```

This will add the `custom_sound` column as the 24th column in your `player_vehicles` table, which stores the sound ID for each vehicle, enabling persistence across server restarts.

**Important**: The script checks your existing table structure and only adds the column if it doesn't already exist, so it's safe to restart the resource multiple times.

## Database Persistence System

The script now includes a comprehensive database persistence system that ensures vehicle sounds are saved and restored automatically.

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Database Setup**: On first run, the script adds a `custom_sound` column to your existing `player_vehicles` table
2. **Ownership Verification**: Only the actual owner of a vehicle can change its engine sound
3. **Automatic Saving**: When a player changes a vehicle's engine sound, it's immediately saved to the database
4. **Automatic Loading**: When vehicles spawn, their saved engine sounds are automatically applied
5. **Cleanup System**: Admin command available to clean up orphaned sound entries

### Database Schema

The script modifies the `player_vehicles` table by adding:
```sql
-- Column #24 - Added automatically by the script
custom_sound VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL
```

**Key Database Operations:**
- **Ownership Check**: `SELECT id FROM player_vehicles WHERE plate = ? AND citizenid = ?`
- **Sound Save**: `UPDATE player_vehicles SET custom_sound = ? WHERE plate = ? AND citizenid = ?`
- **Sound Load**: `SELECT custom_sound FROM player_vehicles WHERE plate = ? AND custom_sound IS NOT NULL`
- **Cleanup**: Removes orphaned entries for non-existent vehicles

### Key Features

- **Persistent Across Restarts**: Vehicle sounds survive server restarts and shutdowns
- **Owner-Only Changes**: Only vehicle owners can modify their vehicle's engine sound
- **Automatic Application**: Saved sounds are applied when vehicles spawn without player intervention
- **Database Integrity**: Built-in cleanup tools for maintaining database health
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient querying and caching to minimize database load

## Usage

### For Players
1. Get in a vehicle **that you own**
2. Type `/changesound` in chat
3. Select your desired engine sound from the searchable menu
4. Your selection is automatically saved and will persist through server restarts!

### For Administrators
- Grant players access by giving them the `mechanic` job or `admin` group permissions
- All sound changes are logged and can be monitored

## Permission System

The script uses a dual permission system:

### Admin Access
- Players with `group.admin` permission can use the script
- Checked via QBX Core's permission system

### Job Access
- Players with the `mechanic` job can use the script
- Perfect for roleplay scenarios where mechanics customize vehicles

## Configuration

### Adding New Sounds

The script is designed to be easily extensible. Here's how to add new engine sounds:

#### Step 1: Prepare Audio Files
You'll need three types of files for each engine sound:
- **`.awc` file**: The actual audio wave pack containing the engine sounds
- **`.dat151.rel` file**: Audio synthesis data (controls how the sound behaves)
- **`.dat54.rel` file**: Audio game data (defines when sounds play)
- **`.dat10.rel` file**: Audio sound data (maps sound names to audio files)

#### Step 2: File Placement
```
CUSTOMSOUNDS/
├── audioconfig/
│   ├── your_engine_amp.dat        # Copy and rename existing .dat151.rel
│   ├── your_engine_game.dat       # Copy and rename existing .dat54.rel
│   └── your_engine_sounds.dat     # Copy and rename existing .dat10.rel
└── sfx/
    └── dlc_your_engine/
        └── your_engine.awc         # Your audio file
```

#### Step 3: Update fxmanifest.lua
Add your new sound entries to `fxmanifest.lua`:

```lua
-- Your Custom Engine Sound --
data_file 'AUDIO_SYNTHDATA' 'audioconfig/your_engine_amp.dat'
data_file 'AUDIO_GAMEDATA' 'audioconfig/your_engine_game.dat'
data_file 'AUDIO_SOUNDDATA' 'audioconfig/your_engine_sounds.dat'
data_file 'AUDIO_WAVEPACK' 'sfx/dlc_your_engine'
```

#### Step 4: Update server.lua
Add your sound to the `EngineSounds` table in `server.lua`:

```lua
-- Add this entry to the EngineSounds table
{label = "Your Custom Engine Description", value = "your_engine_id"},
```

**Example Addition:**
```lua
-- In the appropriate category (e.g., after American Muscle section)
{label = "Custom Supercharged V12", value = "customv12sc"},
{label = "Turbo Diesel V6", value = "tdieselv6"},
```

#### Step 5: Restart Resource
After adding new sounds:
1. Save all files
2. Restart the resource: `restart CUSTOMSOUNDS`
3. The new sounds will appear in the selection menu

### Practical Example: Adding a Ferrari LaFerrari Sound

Let's walk through adding a Ferrari LaFerrari V12 sound as a complete example:

#### 1. Prepare Your Files
```
CUSTOMSOUNDS/
├── audioconfig/
│   ├── laferrari_amp.dat
│   ├── laferrari_game.dat
│   └── laferrari_sounds.dat
└── sfx/
    └── dlc_laferrari/
        └── laferrari.awc
```

#### 2. Add to fxmanifest.lua
```lua
-- Ferrari LaFerrari V12 --
data_file 'AUDIO_SYNTHDATA' 'audioconfig/laferrari_amp.dat'
data_file 'AUDIO_GAMEDATA' 'audioconfig/laferrari_game.dat'
data_file 'AUDIO_SOUNDDATA' 'audioconfig/laferrari_sounds.dat'
data_file 'AUDIO_WAVEPACK' 'sfx/dlc_laferrari'
```

#### 3. Add to server.lua EngineSounds table
```lua
-- In the Ferrari section
{label = "Ferrari LaFerrari V12 Hybrid", value = "laferrari"},
```

#### 4. Restart and Test
```
restart CUSTOMSOUNDS
```

Your new sound will now appear in the menu as "Ferrari LaFerrari V12 Hybrid" and be saved to the database like any other sound.

### Where to Get Sound Files

#### Option 1: Create Your Own
- Record real vehicle sounds
- Use audio editing software (Audacity, Adobe Audition)
- Convert to proper FiveM format using OpenIV or similar tools

#### Option 2: Sound Packs
- Download community-made sound packs
- Check FiveM modding communities (GTAMods, LSPDFR, etc.)
- Ensure you have proper permissions/licenses

#### Option 3: Convert from Other Games
- Extract sounds from other racing games
- Convert using appropriate tools
- Respect copyright and licensing

### File Naming Convention

For consistency, follow this naming pattern:
- **Sound ID**: `brand_model_engine` (e.g., `ford_gt40_v8`)
- **Files**: `brand_model_engine_amp.dat`, `brand_model_engine_game.dat`, etc.
- **Folder**: `dlc_brand_model_engine`

### Testing New Sounds

1. **Add the sound** following steps above
2. **Restart resource**: `restart CUSTOMSOUNDS`
3. **Test in-game**: Use `/changesound` and select your new sound
4. **Verify persistence**: Restart server and check if sound loads correctly

### Troubleshooting New Sounds

**Sound not appearing in menu?**
- Check `server.lua` - ensure entry is added to `EngineSounds` table
- Verify syntax (commas, brackets, quotes)
- Restart the resource

**Sound not playing?**
- Check file paths in `fxmanifest.lua`
- Ensure `.awc` file is in correct folder
- Verify `.dat` files are properly configured

**Sound cuts out or glitches?**
- Check audio file quality and format
- Ensure `.dat` files are properly configured for your audio
- Test with different vehicles

### Community Contributions

If you create high-quality engine sounds, consider:
- Sharing with the FiveM community
- Contributing to sound pack repositories
- Documenting your sound sources and creation process

### Advanced Customization

For more advanced users, you can also:
- Modify existing `.dat` files to change sound behavior
- Create custom sound categories in the menu
- Add sound preview functionality
- Implement sound-to-vehicle-class matching

### Modifying Permissions
Edit the permission check in `server.lua`:

```lua
-- Add custom job access
if Player.PlayerData.job.name == 'your_custom_job' then
    hasPermission = true
end

-- Add custom permission group
if exports.qbx_core:HasPermission(source, 'your.custom.permission') then
    hasPermission = true
end
```
